Requirement:
The objective here is to build a website to enable hospitals, clinics, clinicians, and patients to report medical safety problems in an anonymous way. Medical errors are responsive for so many deaths and injuries world-wide. The knowledge developed is used to define best practices that help avoid clinical errors. These include better clinical procedures, improved medical devices, and more training of the clinical staff. The reported adverse events must encompass all kinds of medical categories to make it easier for organize make effective use of the gathered data. The system must be world-wide and allow for access from any country where users can report adverse events in their locality. Look up the “safety Rule” on the HHS website.
